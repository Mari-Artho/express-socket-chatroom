# express-socket-chatroom
This is a chat room written in JavaScript using its socket.io library.

Each client can open a browser tab at localhost 3000 and chat with other connected clients. The chat does not use local storage, so the chat is not saved.

How to use?
npm start
open https://localhost:3000
